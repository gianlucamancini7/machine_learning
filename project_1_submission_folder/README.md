Authors: Gianluca Mancini and Tullio Nutta

###---  File contents:  --###

run.py = code of the best submission. Automatically creates a submission file with named ‘Group Higgs_Garrix Submission’. Can be directly run from the console (medium/long run time, good accuracy) or opened and mofyfied where suggested by the comments.

PCA.py = functions needed to perform Principal Component Analysis on a database and to predict the labels in the components space (Functionns referring to Feature Space 2)

physics.py = function needed to perform the physics reasoned feature selection on both train and test dataset (Functionns referring to Feature Space 1)

implementations.py = Required solution method function together with some more basic ones needed for them.

additional_implementations.py = All the function needed and coded for predicting the values in the run files add for all the other trials performed to finalize the answer.

exploratory_notebook.ipyb = It contains all the scripts and trials used to come up with the conclusions written in the report. A lot of aspects of all the section are treated and reasoned more in depth with descriptions and code.
